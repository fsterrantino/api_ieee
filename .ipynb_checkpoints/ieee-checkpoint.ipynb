       "   'abstract': 'Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a visual bridge between a software application and end users, through which they can interact with each other. With the upgrading of mobile devices and the development of aesthetics, the visual effects of the GUI are more and more attracting, and users pay more attention to the accessibility and usability of applications. However, such GUI complexity posts a great challenge to the GUI implementation. According to our pilot study of crowdtesting bug reports, display issues such as text overlap, component occlusion, missing image always occur during GUI rendering on different devices due to the software or hardware compatibility. They negatively influence the app usability, resulting in poor user experience. To detect these issues, we propose a fully automated approach, Nighthawk, based on deep learning for modelling visual information of the GUI screenshot. Nighthawk can detect GUIs with display issues and also locate the detailed region of the issue in the given GUI for guiding developers to fix the bug. At the same time, training the model needs a large amount of labeled buggy screenshots, which requires considerable manual effort to prepare them. We therefore propose a heuristic-based training data auto-generation method to automatically generate the labeled training data. The evaluation demonstrates that our Nighthawk can achieve average 0.84 precision and 0.84 recall in detecting UI display issues, average 0.59 AP and 0.60 AR in localizing these issues. We also evaluate Nighthawk with popular Android apps on Google Play and F-Droid, and successfully uncover 151 previously-undetected UI display issues with 75 of them being confirmed or fixed so far.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This paper presents a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Builder for embedded systems and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The hardware platforms used in CPSs may employ physical devices without graphical and user-input capabilities, or devices that may be placed on multiple remote locations, often with difficult physical access, that brings new challenges to GUI design. The proposed tool, integrated within the IOPT-Flow framework, enables a new approach to answer these challenges. This framework supports the development of embedded systems and distributed CPSs, offering a set of web-based tools for model edition, simulation, and implementation on physical devices. Systems are designed using graphical models combining Data-flows, Signals, and Petri nets, that permit the specification of remote communication channels just by drawing arcs. The new GUI Builder tool uses this infrastructure to automate the creation of graphical user interfaces for embedded systems and distributed CPSs, benefiting from a development with combined design, validation and automatic code generation methods. Finally, an application example of a power wheelchair controller integrating a GUI, is presented.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Online shopping has revolutionized our daily lives in the modern era. We can purchase needed goods on mobile shopping applications (apps) anytime and anywhere without leaving home. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have become increasingly dependent on various mobile shopping activities. However, the visual design of the shopping app interface often affects the user’s interactive experience and the efficiency of browsing product information. In addition, gender differences are also worth being considered in the shopping interface design process. To achieve the goal, the research conducted a user study (N=40) of a  $2\\\\times $  2 x 2 mixed factorial design (i.e., information layout x display mode x gender difference). Each participant performed four tasks during the experiment. The authors measured the task completion time, collected the subjective responses from the SUS and the 7-point Likert scale questionnaire, and interviewed participants. The results revealed that: (1) females perform faster in lighter mode when searching for information location, while males perform faster in darker mode. (2) The information layout affects the user’s visual search performance and subjective evaluation; females prefer the list style, but men prefer the matrix style. (3) Participants (both males and females) perceived matrix style as more popular than list style in dark mode; however, the result was reversed in light mode. The findings generated from the research can serve as a good reference for the development of user experience in the user interface design of mobile shopping apps.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"The adoption of voice user interface (VUI) will promote network automation with enhanced efficiency with reduced simplicity and operating expense in Industry 5.0. Given the noisy environments, speech denoising is indispensable for the VUI in Internet of Things (IoT) or Industrial IoT (IIoT). Despite Transformer's recent success in speech denoising, the adopted full self-attention suffers from quadratic complexity, which challenges the computational power of the IoT/IIoT components. Considering the strong local correlations of speech signals, a speech-oriented sparse attention denoising scheme is developed to keep the meaningful local and global dependencies while mitigating the redundant attentions, resulting in a significant reduction in computational complexity. With the full self-attention as the baseline, experimental results revealed that the proposed scheme achieves a better denoising performance and yields a lower computational cost, indicating the strong potential for various VUI application scenarios in IoT and IIoT toward Industry 5.0.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Using standard handheld interfaces for VR locomotion may not provide a believable self-motion experience and can contribute to unwanted side effects such as motion sickness, disorientation, or increased cognitive load. This paper demonstrates how using a seated leaning-based locomotion interface –HeadJoystick– in VR ground-based navigation affects user experience, usability, and performance. In three within-subject studies, we compared controller (touchpad/thumbstick) with a more embodied interface (”HeadJoystick”) where users moved their head and/or leaned in the direction of desired locomotion. In both conditions, users sat on a regular office chair and used it to control virtual rotations. In the first study, 24 participants used HeadJoystick versus Controller in three complementary tasks including reach-the-target, follow-the-path, and racing (dynamic obstacle avoidance). In the second study, 18 participants repeatedly used HeadJoystick versus Controller (8 one-minute trials each) in a reach-the-target task. To evaluate potential benefits of different brake mechanisms, in the third study 18 participants were asked to stop within each target area for one second. All three studies consistently showed advantages of HeadJoystick over Controller: we observed improved performance in all tasks, as well as higher user ratings for enjoyment, spatial presence, immersion, vection intensity, usability, ease of learning, ease of use, and rated potential for daily and long-term use, while reducing motion sickness and task load. Overall, our results suggest that leaning-based interfaces such as HeadJoystick provide an interesting and more embodied alternative to handheld interfaces in driving, reach-the-target, and follow-the-path tasks, and potentially a wider range of scenarios.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Waiting is an indispensable and inevitable part of man-machine voice interaction. The voice user interface (VUI) feedback mechanism is a key factor affecting voice interaction’s waiting experience. The feedback time of most available voice interfaces is fixed or decided by the processing time of hardware and software, which has not been designed and cannot offer users a good interaction experience. In this paper, the speech rate of user-machine voice interaction is collected through prototype experimentation. Besides, users’ time perception of different voice interfaces’ feedback time settings is studied based on time psychology theories. Moreover, users’ emotional changes are described after a specific feedback time with the distribution of two-dimension arousal-valence emotion space. Users’ time perception and subjective emotions are differently influenced by different VUI feedback times. The experimental results show that 750 ms is the optimal VUI feedback time point at which the best users’ subjective feelings and psychological experiences are reached, and the threshold limit time spent by users in waiting for the VUI feedback is 1,850 ms which will lead to user emotions with low levels of arousal and valence after being exceeded. Based on that, a linear regression model is proposed to define the optimal feedback time of VUI. The user experience VUI research results show that the calculated feedback time parameters can make users produce time perception in line with their expectations in interacting with voice interfaces.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'With the increasing use of large-screen portable devices and the prevalence of list-based user interfaces, it has become critically important to design list interfaces that are visually appealing and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes. The rules for adapting list-based user interfaces on large screens warrant investigation. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the responsive list width that can enhance visual search efficiency and improve user experience on portable devices with different widths of screen. Two experiments were conducted, in which we manipulated the width of single-column and parent-child lists on portable devices with medium- (Experiment 1; N = 80) and large-width screens (Experiment 2; N = 41), varying the range of list width from very narrow to very wide. Results show that for the single-column lists on a medium-width screen, users demonstrated the highest level of preference and gave the highest ratings for satisfaction and visual aesthetics when the lists were moderately wide. For the single-column lists on a large-width screen, users preferred both the moderately-narrow and moderately-wide lists. However, for parent-child lists, the results show that both the moderately-wide and very-wide lists were favored on both the medium-width and large-width screens. These findings may be attributed to users’ preference for the appropriate white space on different screens, thereby providing useful guidelines for the responsive design of lists on portable devices.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'We introduce a model-based feedback-driven test adaptation approach for end-to-end user interface testing of smart TVs. From the perspective of the TV software, the proposed approach is a non-intrusive and completely black-box approach, which operates by interpreting the screen images. Given a test suite, which is known to work in an older version of the TV, and a new version of the TV, to which the test suite should be adapted, the proposed approach first automatically discovers user interface models for both the older and the new version of TV by opportunistically crawling the TVs. Then, each test case in the test suite is executed on the old version, and the path traversed by the test case in the respective UI model is found. Finally, a semantically equivalent path in the UI model discovered for the new version of the TV is determined and dynamically executed on the new version in a feedback-driven manner. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach in a setup that closely mimics the industrial setup used by a large consumer electronics company. While the proposed approach successfully adapted all the test cases, the alternative approaches used in the experiments could not adapt any of them.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A brain-computer interface (BCI) measures and analyzes brain activity and converts it into computer commands to control external devices. Traditional BCIs usually require full calibration, which is time-consuming and makes BCI systems inconvenient to use. In this study, we propose an online P300 BCI spelling system with zero or shortened calibration based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and big electroencephalography (EEG) data. Specifically, three methods are proposed to train CNNs for the online detection of P300 potentials: (i) training a subject-independent CNN with data collected from 150 subjects; (ii) adapting the CNN online via a semisupervised learning/self-training method based on unlabeled data collected during the user’s online operation; and (iii) fine-tuning the CNN with a transfer learning method based on a small quantity of labeled data collected before the user’s online operation. Note that the calibration process is eliminated in the first two methods and dramatically shortened in the third method. Based on these methods, an online P300 spelling system is developed. Twenty subjects participated in our online experiments. Average accuracies of 89.38%, 94.00% and 93.50% were obtained by the subject-independent CNN, the self-training-based CNN and the transfer learning-based CNN, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and thus, the convenience of the online P300-based BCI system is substantially improved.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Studies have highlighted the possible advantages of tangible user interfaces (TUIs) over multitouch interfaces (MTIs) in preschool education; however, more objective evidence is required to establish the superiority of TUIs. In this article, we design a mathematical application called THE NUMBERS to compare preschool children's learning potential and employed the eye-tracking method to assess the cognitive differences between the TUI and MTI versions. The results demonstrate that the TUI version participants made more attempts in the task, which was a significant predictor of learning outcomes. Furthermore, using TUIs leads to lower cognitive load, increases attention on key areas, and provides higher entertainment value, which has long-term effects on promoting preschool children's learning. The results of the perception questionnaire show that the TUI version is easier to use, more interesting, and more motivating for them to learn mathematics than the MTI version is. On the other hand, the interview results show that 62.5% of students prefer to use the TUI version to learn mathematics. The results can provide educators with a deeper understanding of the mental characteristics involved in MTIs and TUIs to enable them to design educational applications that are more suitable for preschool children.\",\n",
